# dream

Goal: Compose the end-to-end memory cleanup workflow.
Non-Goals: Knowledge-base recording or unrelated file orchestration.
Use-When: The user wants memory summarized, compressed, or cleaned.

## 0. Prerequisites
- A resolved memory file
- The `memory-interface` contract
- The `remember`, `envision`, `learn`, `memory-summary`, and `memorize` skills

## 1. Inputs
- The full memory file
- Expanded memory context
- Candidate summary updates
- Approval context for destructive summary rewrites

## 2. Processes
1. Read and follow the `memory-interface` contract.
2. Process the entire memory file every time, not only entries since the last breadcrumb.
3. Read memory via `remember`.
4. Expand via `envision`.
5. Reduce via `learn`.
6. Normalize via `memory-summary`.
7. Write back summary/log updates to the memory file.
8. Treat `# Summary` as the durable memory record.
9. Require user approval for full `# Summary` rewrites, especially when deleting specific existing Summary items or resolving contradictions.
10. Present summary rewrite approvals as a git diff-style patch.
11. Allow routine compression when it mostly appends and deduplicates Memory Log content into Summary.
12. Delete fully processed log entries and leave a breadcrumb comment after compression.
13. Leave new breadcrumbs for the current compression; later runs may remove old breadcrumbs when cleaning the file.
14. Do not call `record`; memory and knowledge base remain uncoupled.
15. Perform direct file edits when required to complete the chain.

## 3. Outputs
- Updated memory file content
- Optional approval patch for Summary rewrites
- Optional compression breadcrumb

## 4. Next Steps
- `memorize` — append additional memory entries when needed
- `remember` — inspect the cleaned memory later

## 5. Examples

### Example 1

**Prompt:** Clean up this memory file.
**Outcome:** Expands, reduces, normalizes, and writes back updated memory.
