# knowledge

Goal: Define the passive MKF concept, bundle, and manual discovery contract for knowledge consumers.
Non-Goals: Do not perform lookup, resolve bundles operationally, write concepts, rebuild indexes, rank matches, or synthesize answers.
Use-When: `input/lookup`, `output/record`, or another skill needs the shared MKF contract before reading, checking, reviewing, or writing knowledge.

## Selection

Default: return only the compact knowledge contract.

Also select:
- `concept_frontmatter_template.md` when the caller asks to record or draft a concept.
- `knowledge_checklist.md` when the caller asks to check MKF conformance.
- `knowledge_quality.md` when the caller asks to review MKF quality.

If caller intent is unclear, assume default contract only and state the assumption.
If requested knowledge needs fall outside this interface, state the unsupported need and hand off to `input/lookup` or `output/record`.

## Return

Always return selected package-local paths followed by loaded contents in fenced code blocks.

Default path:
- `references/knowledge_contract.md`

Optional paths:
- `assets/concept_frontmatter_template.md`
- `references/knowledge_checklist.md`
- `references/knowledge_quality.md`

## Next Steps

- `input/lookup` — resolve bundles operationally, search MKF metadata, and load selected concepts.
- `output/record` — create or update MKF concepts and rebuild generated indexes.
- `transform/check` — check MKF conformance with `knowledge_checklist.md`.
- `transform/review` — review MKF quality with `knowledge_quality.md`.

## Minimal Example

Prompt: "Use the knowledge interface before recording a new concept."
Return:

file_path: references/knowledge_contract.md
```markdown
[loaded compact knowledge contract]
```
