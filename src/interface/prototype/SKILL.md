# prototype

Goal: Define the minimal prototype contract and best-fit validation profile for cheap learning.
Non-Goals: Do not build prototypes, run validation sessions, produce production implementations, or polish final deliverables.
Use-When: Another skill needs the `prototype` interface before outlining, drafting, modifying, checking, reviewing, or orchestrating a validation artifact.

## Selection

Default: return the compact prototype contract, choose the best-fit profile when possible, and list other profiles as course-correction options.

Also select:
- The selected profile template when the caller asks to outline or draft a prototype.
- The selected profile quality checklist when the caller asks to check/review a prototype or validate before spending effort.

Profiles:
- `tabletop-roleplay`
- `ui-mockup`
- `process-scenario`
- `api-contract-stub`
- `data-layout-structure`

If caller intent is unclear, assume default contract only and state the assumption.
If requested prototype needs fall outside this interface, state the unsupported need and hand off to the appropriate skill.

## Return

Always return selected package-local paths followed by loaded contents in fenced code blocks.

Default path:
- `references/prototype_contract.md`

Optional paths are listed in the selected contract's profile table.

## Next Steps

- `outline` — create the prototype skeleton from the selected template.
- `draft` — fill the selected template with first-pass content.
- `modify` — revise an existing prototype while preserving selected quality criteria.
- `transform/check` — check prototype conformance against selected criteria.
- `transform/review` — review prototype quality before validation effort.

## Minimal Example

Prompt: "Use the prototype interface to validate account recovery escalation support."
Return:

file_path: references/prototype_contract.md
```markdown
[loaded compact prototype contract with selected profile and alternate profiles]
```
