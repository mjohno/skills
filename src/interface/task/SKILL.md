# task

Goal: Define the minimal task packet contract for portable, self-contained implementation context.
Non-Goals: Do not draft, extract, update, implement, verify, manage whole plans, or place comments directly in files.
Use-When: Another skill needs the `task` interface contract before drafting, modifying, extracting, checking, reviewing, or stepping through a task packet.

## Selection

Default: return only the compact task contract.

Also select:
- `task_extraction.md` when the caller asks to extract a task from a plan item, annotation, spec, review finding, or prompt.
- `task_checklist.md` when the caller asks to check task conformance.
- `task_quality.md` when the caller asks to review task quality.

If caller intent is unclear, assume default contract only and state the assumption.
If requested task needs fall outside this interface, state the unsupported need and hand off to the appropriate skill.

## Return

Always return selected package-local paths followed by loaded contents in fenced code blocks.

Default path:
- `references/task_contract.md`

Optional paths:
- `references/task_extraction.md`
- `references/task_checklist.md`
- `references/task_quality.md`

## Next Steps

- `draft` — create a first-pass task packet.
- `modify` — revise a task packet while preserving stable IDs.
- `transform/check` — check task conformance with `task_checklist.md`.
- `transform/review` — review task quality with `task_quality.md`.
- `map/step` — execute one task packet.

## Minimal Example

Prompt: "Use the task interface for plan item AUTH-2."
Return:

file_path: references/task_contract.md
```markdown
[loaded compact task contract]
```
