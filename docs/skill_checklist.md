# Skill Checklist

## Base Checklist

Inherits all items from [base_checklist.md](base_checklist.md). Apply base items before these skill-specific items. Use this checklist for `metadata.type: skill` only; use [interface_checklist.md](interface_checklist.md) for interfaces and [persona_checklist.md](persona_checklist.md) for personas.

## Skill-Specific CRITICAL

- [ ] **CRITICAL** `metadata.type: skill`
- [ ] **CRITICAL** `metadata.category` is `input`, `transform`, `output`, or `map`
- [ ] **CRITICAL** Under `# [Name]`: Goal (mandatory), Non-Goals (mandatory), Use-When (mandatory)
- [ ] **CRITICAL** Section 0: Prerequisites present
- [ ] **CRITICAL** Section 1: Inputs present (inline OR references/input_*.md / assets/input_*.md)
- [ ] **CRITICAL** Section 2: Processes present (inline OR references/process_*.md / assets/process_*.md)
- [ ] **CRITICAL** Section 3: Outputs present (inline OR references/output_*.md / assets/output_*.md)
- [ ] **CRITICAL** Section 4: Next Steps present (suggested downstream skills)
- [ ] **CRITICAL** Section 5: Examples present (at least one)

## Skill-Specific QUALITY

- [ ] **QUALITY** Goals do not include multiple distinct objectives. If there are multiple, they should be split into separate skills.
- [ ] **QUALITY** Non-Goals do not invert the Goal. They add value by clarifying the scope of the Goal.
- [ ] **QUALITY** The list of processes is ideally 5 items. >=10 is a strong signal that the skill is doing too much and should be split.
- [ ] **QUALITY** **Clear scope** — Fewest non-overlapping options, categories, or branches needed; no redundant logic
- [ ] **QUALITY** **Minimal default output** — Only essentials returned by default; detail is opt-in
- [ ] **QUALITY** **Graceful handoff** — When it can't solve something, does it suggest specific downstream skills (e.g., lookup, remember)?
- [ ] **QUALITY** **Structure matches purpose** — Sections flow logically (prerequisites → inputs → processes → outputs → next steps) and read like a contract

## Definition of Done

A skill passes compliance if all base CRITICAL items and all skill-specific CRITICAL items pass. A beautifully simple skill also passes all QUALITY items.
