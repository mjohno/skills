# Skill Taxonomy

This repository uses a role-based skill taxonomy. Each category defines the skill's primary role in the system.

## Mental Model

- **Nouns are interfaces** — artifact schemas, storage contracts, protocols, and canonical shapes.
- **Vocabulary is context** — human-loaded term definitions that shape interpretation without model invocation.
- **Specialized verbs are invocable skills** — skills that retrieve, transform, persist, or orchestrate work through a dedicated contract.
- **Protocols are governed interaction contracts** — stateful or approval-sensitive flows that agents follow through an authoritative interface.
- **Personas are lenses** — perspectives that modify how another skill evaluates or presents information.

## Metadata Model

Every package declares both type and category:

- `metadata.type` describes runtime treatment:
  - `interface` — passive contract provider selected and loaded for context
  - `vocabulary` — human-loadable context definitions with model invocation disabled
  - `skill` — invocable behavior that retrieves, transforms, writes, or orchestrates
  - `protocol` — governed interaction contract, usually map-category, that defines safe transitions between agent, user, tools, and state
  - `persona` — composable lens that changes evaluation or presentation
- `metadata.category` describes taxonomy placement and primary role.

Valid pairs:
- `type: interface`, `category: interface`
- `type: vocabulary`, `category: interface`
- `type: skill`, `category: input|transform|output|map`
- `type: protocol`, `category: map`, with top-level `disable_model_invocation: true`
- `type: persona`, `category: persona`

## Categories

### interface
Passive noun/domain contract packages that supply conventions, quality checks, templates, schemas, protocols, artifact shapes, vocabulary, or storage rules used by verb skills.
- Declares `metadata.category: interface` with either `metadata.type: interface` or `metadata.type: vocabulary`
- Selected and loaded when another skill needs artifact shape, schema, protocol, conventions, quality criteria, or storage rules; vocabulary packages are human-loaded instead
- Lives as direct packages under `src/interface/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Examples: `interface/spec`, `interface/rfc`, `interface/plan`, `interface/task`, `interface/code`, `interface/prose`, `interface/script`, `interface/prototype`, `interface/memory`, `interface/knowledge-base`, `interface/vocab`
- Defines the desired state of a noun-like artifact, protocol, domain, or context vocabulary
- May select an applicable domain from context, such as a script language or storage backend
- Returns the minimal selected reference/asset file paths and exposes their loaded contents to consuming skills, except vocabulary packages whose SKILL.md body is the human-loaded context
- Domain- or intent-specific materials should be clearly named, e.g. `python_template.py`, `plan_quality.md`, `plan_checklist.md`, or `github_protocol.md`
- **Do NOT use if** the package performs artifact production, external retrieval, transformation, evaluation, persistence, or orchestration — it only supplies contract data or vocabulary context for other skills to apply

### vocabulary
Special interface-category packages that define project operational terms for human-loaded context.
- Declares `metadata.type: vocabulary` and `metadata.category: interface`
- Requires top-level `disable_model_invocations: true`
- Is loaded directly by a human before prompting; the model should not invoke or route to it
- Defines only terms that are not already owned by skill names or skill descriptions
- Keeps terms in the `description` trigger and body content; do not add frontmatter term metadata
- May include compact behavioral controls, but contains no formal inputs, processes, outputs, return contract, verification, or next-step behavior
- Project `vocab` is operational vocabulary; knowledge-base `glossary` content is domain-local terminology
- **Do NOT use if** the term needs structured inputs, formal outputs, verification criteria, or multi-step process — create or update a verb skill instead

### input
Skills that bring information into the working context from outside the current reasoning process.
- Reads, retrieves, fetches, or elicits source data
- Returns raw or structured context
- Does not usually rewrite or persist
- Examples: `input/investigate`, `input/lookup`, `input/remember`, `input/grill-me`
- **Do NOT use if** the skill primarily evaluates, prioritizes, restructures, or writes the data — it only brings source information in

### transform
Skills that operate on existing context or artifacts to derive, evaluate, restructure, prioritize, reduce, or convert information into a more useful intermediate form.
- Turns current context into decisions, findings, checks, rankings, summaries, or other working material
- May evaluate evidence, apply criteria, dedupe, compress, rank, or critique
- Does not primarily retrieve external data or persist final outputs
- Examples: `transform/check`, `transform/rank`, `transform/review`, `transform/learn`
- **Do NOT use if** the skill primarily retrieves source data, writes final artifacts, or orchestrates an end-to-end workflow

### output
Verb-shaped production skills that create, revise, persist, store, or deliver results outward.
- Performs production actions with dedicated contracts, such as record, memorize, annotate, or commit
- Consumes interface-defined artifact nouns and storage contracts when structure matters
- May write files, records, logs, or artifacts when requested
- **Do NOT use if** the skill only defines an artifact schema or canonical form — use an interface skill for nouns

### map
Workflow composition skills and protocols that orchestrate multiple steps.
- Combines other skills and/or direct file operations
- Owns end-to-end execution of a process
- Hosts `metadata.type: protocol` packages when the primary role is governing agent/user/tool/state transitions
- **Do NOT use if** the package performs a single focused task — it only orchestrates others

### protocol
Map-category packages that define governed interaction contracts rather than ordinary invocable behavior.
- Declares `metadata.type: protocol`, `metadata.category: map`, and top-level `disable_model_invocation: true`
- Defines safe transitions between agent, user, tools, and persistent or derived state
- May be mediated by a CLI, API, or compact instruction surface; CLIs are optional, not required by the type
- Uses its authoritative interface to expose workflow stages and legal operations when one exists
- Is not directly invocable by the model; it is loaded by a human/orchestrator as protocol context
- Examples: `map/step`
- **Do NOT use if** the package only performs a normal one-shot task — use `type: skill` instead

### persona
Skills that encode a consistent perspective, tradeoff-awareness, or output style across any pipeline stage.
- Provides perspective, voice, or evaluation criteria independent of data flow
- **Modifies how information flows** through the system — a persona skill wraps or augments a data-flow category
- Composable with any invocable skill
- Reduces total skill count by making each skill work across multiple viewpoints
- **Do NOT use if** the skill's primary role is data retrieval, transformation, persistence, orchestration, or contract definition — it only modifies perspective

## Composition Patterns

Interfaces define contract data that invocable skills consume:

- **interface/vocab** — Human-load project terms such as `study`, `outline`, `draft`, `modify`, `simplify`, or `lean` before the first prompt; reserve dedicated skills for verbs that need a specialized contract or workflow.
- **interface/spec + outline** — Outline a traceable future-state spec using the spec template.
- **interface/spec + draft** — Draft a generic future-state spec using the spec contract.
- **interface/code + modify** — Modify code while preserving code-brief boundaries and verification hints.
- **interface/knowledge-base + output/record** — Record durable knowledge using the KB root and entry contract.
- **interface/memory + output/memorize** — Append memory using the memory file and entry contract.

Personas modify how information is evaluated at any pipeline stage:

- **transform/review + persona/security** — Run `review` with the security persona as the evaluation lens.
- **input/grill-me + persona/adversarial** — Stress-test a design, then re-evaluate residual risks through the adversarial persona.
- **transform/check + persona/adversarial** — Validate whether claims, results, or outcomes survive a hostile reading of the criteria.

## Notes

- `metadata.type` describes how the package is used at runtime; `metadata.category` describes role and placement.
- Categories describe primary role. Packages may touch adjacent concerns, but their category reflects the dominant behavior.
- `interface` packages define shared contracts and are discoverable for model use. They may return applicable conventions, checks, templates, schemas, or protocol rules, but they do not operate on the artifact themselves.
- `vocabulary` packages are not model-invocable; they are compact context definitions loaded by a human.
- Loading package-local interface references/assets is part of exposing contract data, not external retrieval.
- `transform` intentionally covers both evaluation and derivation; split it only if future usage shows a concrete need.
- Refer to [interface_template.md](interface_template.md), [vocab_template.md](vocab_template.md), [skill_template.md](skill_template.md), [protocol_template.md](protocol_template.md), and [persona_template.md](persona_template.md) for frontmatter format.
